Feature: proper routingPath and token requestPath is used for provider call

  Scenario: Consumer calls proxy route with remoteNo PathNo TrailingNo, upstream path /
    Given RealRoute headers are set
    When consumer calls the proxy route with remoteNoPathNoTrailingNo
    And API consumer receives a 200 status code

  Scenario: Consumer calls proxy route with remoteNo PathNo TrailingYes, upstream path /
    Given RealRoute headers are set
    When consumer calls the proxy route with remoteNoPathNoTrailingYes
    And API consumer receives a 200 status code

  Scenario: Consumer calls proxy route with remoteYes PathNo TrailingNo, upstream path /base
